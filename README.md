# Final-Project
# Outline

For my project, I'm going to be focusing on creating a story for a project that I've been working on during my internship at the Healthcare Council of Western PA. The project focusses on increasing health insurance literacy in the state, by conducting teach-the-trainer modules and certifying people who attend these sessions as 'health insurance literate'. Morevoer, a small monetary incentive is also provided to those attending these sessions.  While this sounds like a great project for public well being, it's hard to get a size-able amount of funding for the same.
